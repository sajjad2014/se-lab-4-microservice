This project is the fourth assignment of the *Software Engineering Lab*.<br>

In this project, the backend for a website similar to twitter is implemented in which each user has a profile and can create a tweet.

The goal of this assignment was to design this backend in such a way that it includes several design patterns such as *Message Broker*, *API Composition, etc.
